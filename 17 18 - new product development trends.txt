facilitating factors
- increased access to manufacturing systems i.e. 3d printer, school laser cutter
- free 3d cad software e.g. freecad, fusion360
- social media for design and fabrication e.g. thingiverse, grabcad, turbosquid
- improved knowledge sharing e.g. youtube, skillshare, brilliant.org, forums
- maker culture


CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN FIRM LED DEVELOPMENT

closed innovation to open innovation
traditional funnel model >> open innovation funnel (external inflow and external outflow)

crowdsourcing
    part of the design process originally undertaken by employees, being outsourced to
    a large number of individuals
    e.g. quirky, openIDEO


COMMUNITY BASED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

open source hardware
    e.g. reprap, open source ecology, aleph object lulzbot

the four freedoms:
    freedom to study
    freedom to make
    freedom to modify
    freedom to redistribute

open source hardware vs open source development


                                                  process openess
                                |    -closed design-              -open design-
   product     -closed source-  |      conventional               crowdsourcing
  openness                      | 
(hardware)      -open source-   |   downloadable design            open source

open source e.g.
    linux
