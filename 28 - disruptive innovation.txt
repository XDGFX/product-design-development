When an established market leader, under threat from a new low priced competitor, moves 
their operations upstream (meaning more expensive, more advanced, more profitable, 
harder etc...), chasing more sophisticated customers who are willing to pay more for a 
more sophisticated product, rather than staying to defend a low profit, highly 
commoditised, area of their business.

This strategy of climbing to increase profitability gives the new entrant at the bottom
of the market an opportunity to take hold and establish themselves as a credible player in
this market. They will then in time also move upstream as their offering improves, or when 
they attract their own competition. Eventually replacing the incumbent completely in an 
ongoing cycle of disruption after disruption.

The key controversy of the theory, is that the incumbent 
market leader is at no point making bad business decisions. At each step they increase 
profitability, but still ultimately lose out and may cease to exist.
