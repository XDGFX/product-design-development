- Internal energy: controls the natural behaviour of the snake. Designed ot minimise sake's curbature and make it behave in an elastic manner.
- Image energy: attracts snake to desired features in image, e.g. edges, lines etc

E_snake(v(s)) = intergral over length of snake E_int v(s) + E_im v(s) ds
