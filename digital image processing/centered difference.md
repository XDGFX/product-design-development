# Why use a centered difference over a non-centered difference? What can you use to prove your points? [3]

May be a better representation of the derivative of discreet values, as it considers the gradient on both sides of the point.
Can be proved by Taylor Series expansion, the error is on the order of x^2 rather than x, which means for small delta x the error is smaller.
