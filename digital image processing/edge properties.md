# What two component properties does each point on an edge have? How can edges be drawn on an image? [3]

Represented as a vector variable. Each point as a magnitude and a direction.
Can be drawn like a topological map with contours; e.g. intensity is height, white is high and black is low.

Magnitude is 'down the hill', whereas direction is *along* the edge.
