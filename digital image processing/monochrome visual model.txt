# Describe the monochrome visual model. What are the weights? [6]

- Receptors (rods for b&w) go into
- Log transfer function into
- Weights
- Into a sum
- Into a single neural signal for multiple rods (weighted sum of contributions from spatially adjacent receptors)

Weights showing impulse response of the eye:
Like a mexican hat - e.g. peak in the middle then negative at 2 and 3 receptors to each side, then oscillations
Helps to perform edge enhancement
