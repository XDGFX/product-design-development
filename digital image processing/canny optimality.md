# What optimal criteria should edge detectors display? [6]

ðŸ”¬ Good detection:
Important edges should not be missed, no spurious responses

ðŸŽ¯ Good localisation:
Distance between the actual and location position for the edge should be minimal

ðŸ“ˆ Single response:
Minimises multiple responses to a single edge
