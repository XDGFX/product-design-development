# What is the aim for adaptive linear filters? Explain an example adaptive linear filter. [4]

Improve the performance of edges over standard linear filters; controls the aggressiveness of the filter.

Unsharp mask
x_out = x_mean + k(x - x_mean)

k varies between merging the original value and the mean value within the mask window.
k is varied based on controlled statistics within the window, e.g. the signal to noise ratio SNR

SNR = x_mean / standard deviation

Has the effect to minimise blurring when there are lots of changes in the image (e.g. a edge) and maximise blurring with low s.d., where there are no edges.
