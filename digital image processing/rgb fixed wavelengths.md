# What is a limitation with using fixed wavelengths for RGB colour? [2]

You cannot produce all the colours by using fixed wavelengths of RGB.
Each colour actually has a range of wavelengths that still count as e.g. red, you need to use this range to be able to produce the full visible light spectrum.
