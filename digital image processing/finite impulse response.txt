# What is a finite impulse response? [3]

A FIR filter.
When subject to an impulse as an input:
 1       .
         |
         |
         |
 0  .....|..........
        t=0

The output will eventually settle back to zero
 1       .
         |.
         ||.
         |||..
 0  .....|||||......
        t=0  t<inf

An infinite impulse response will response infinitely, likely through some kind of feedback.
