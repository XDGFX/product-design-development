# What are three commonly used vector norms? [3]

- L_1 norm (city block distance)
To get between two points you can only move in x and y, no diagonals (e.g. city blocks in New York)

- L_2 norm (euclidean distance)
The shortest distance between the two, a^2 + b^2 = c^2

- L_inf norm (chessboard distance)
The maximum distance in one ordinal direction; e.g. the max distance of [delta_x, delta_y]
