# What two types of filters are there? Give some examples of each. [5]

Linear:
- Smoothing (e.g. mean)
- Edge detection
* Can F.T.

Nonlinear:
- Rank / order statistics (e.g. median)
- Adaptive linear (function depends on statistics of input values)
* No F.T.

Filter masks can be different sizes and shapes
Linear filters can separate the mask in x and y direction (e.g. a cross into two separate rectangles)
Might be adaptively changing shape
