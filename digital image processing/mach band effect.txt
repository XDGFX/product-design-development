# What does the human eye do at edges? What is the effect called? [4]

Mach band effect - edge enhancement.
The response overshoots at changes in brightness; instead of a clean step response it overshoots and undershoots at the edges.

This enhances the edge, making it clearer for us to distinguish different objects.
