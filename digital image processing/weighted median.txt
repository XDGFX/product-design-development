# What is a weighted median filter? [4]

Median filter = Rank (N+1)/2 {f1, f2, f3 ... fN}

Weighted median filter = Rank (N+1)/2 {w1*f1, w2*f2 ... wN*fN}
where * is not multiplication, but the number of times the value appears in the list
e.g. 3*f1 would be f1 f1 f1

A centre weighted median filter has w > 1 at the centre and w = 1 elsewhere
[
    1   1   1
    1   3   1
    1   1   1
]

If the centre is 9, the median will always be the centre value; e.g. no filtering at all

Key point: weight depends on the position in the mask window, not position in the list!
