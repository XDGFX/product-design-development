# What is one benefit sequential filters (e.g. alternating sequential filter sieves) have over linear filters? [2]

They do not move the image spatially with different filter sizes.

E.g. an image with two dots when blurred with a mean filter will move the position of the dots outwards, until they become one single blob

Sieving will not move the edges of the dots at all, the colour will just blend as size increases (in the case of grayscale sieving).
