# What is an adaptive weighted median filter? What do weights depend on? [4]

Weights depend on:
- Image statistics
- Position in mask (d)

w(i, j) = [W(K+1, K+1) - (c*d*std) / x_mean]

where:
w is weight at position i, j
W is the central weight
c is a constant
d is the distrance from the centre of the mask
