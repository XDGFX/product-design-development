# What are the matrices for translation and scale transformations on homogeneous coordinates? [6]

Shift:
x_transformed = T(d) * x_homogeneous
where T(d) =
[
    1   0   0   -dx
    0   1   0   -dy
    0   0   1   -dz
    0   0   0   1
]

Scale:
x_transformed = S(s) * x_homogeneous
where S(s) = 
[
    s   0   0   0
    0   s   0   0
    0   0   s   0
    0   0   0   1
