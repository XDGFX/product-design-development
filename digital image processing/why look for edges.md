# What is an edge? Why look for edges? What are some types of edge? [8]

An edge is:
- the boundary between two regions with relatively distinct grey level properties (this includes texture)
- a sharp intensity transition between neighbouring pixels (doesn't include texture but simpler)

Important because:
- information is concentrated at the edges, even though they take up 5-10% of the pixels
- can be used in computer vision for feature extraction, segmentation etc.

May be a ramp edge, step edge, or ridge edge
