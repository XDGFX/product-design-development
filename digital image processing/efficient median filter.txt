# Describe an efficient median algoithm. [5]

Use a histogram sort, instead of calculating the new median each time
- Make the histogram using the values within the filter window
- Count from lowest value to highest value until you get to half the window size (e.g. 5th value for 9 values). Otherwise, the 5th value in the histogram
- For next window, just remove all histogram entries for left column, add in new values from right column
- Now: calculate less than median (LTM)
    - For removed values, if they are below the median add 1 to LTM
    - For added values, if they are below the median subtract 1 from LTM
    - LTM value will be the shift to get to the new median
