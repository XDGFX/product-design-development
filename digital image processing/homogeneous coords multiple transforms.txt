# If you want to perform multiple transformations on a homogeneous image, how could you do it? [2]

Composite transform; do multiple operations at once

e.g.
x_transformed = P(f) * R(Î¸) * T(d) * x_homogeneous

The order is important; in this case translation is first, then rotation, then perspective change.
Using a different order will produce a different result.
