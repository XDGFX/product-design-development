# What kinds of processing happens to interpret visual information from your eyes? What are the main parts of your eye? [8]

Some pre-processing happens at the back of the eye
Low, medium, and high level processing happens in the brain. We know where but don't fully understand how yet.

Two eyes alow stereo vision

Cornea protects eye at the front
Iris is a diaphram which controls the amount of light going into the eye
Lens is flexible and does focussing
Fovea is the greatest density of cones, sharpest vision
Choroid is the blood supply
Sclera is protective coating

Two types of receptors: rods (100 million, black and white, long and thin) and cones (6.5 million, short and fatm short and fat)

Rods share neural connections
Cones have single neural connections; they are more important

Three types of cones: green, red, and blue
