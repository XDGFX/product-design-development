# What are the benefits of homogeneous coordinates? How do you move to them from fixed image coordinates? [3]

Provide a linear and general coordinate system where image transformations are matrix operations (instead of different mathematical functions)

Multiply matrix by an arbitrary scalar, w

x_cartesian = [x, y, z](transpose)
x_homogeneous = [wx, wy, wz, w](transpose)
