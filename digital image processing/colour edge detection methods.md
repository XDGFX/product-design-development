# Describe the overall system processes for three different colour edge detection methods. [5]

Main method:

1. Image decomposition (into different channels)
2. Model matching (e.g. sobel operation)
3. Edge detection (e.g. thresholding)
4. Edge map

Output Fusion Methods:
Image recombination between 3 and 4

Multidimensional Gradient Methods:
Image recombination between 2 and 3

Vector Methods:
Image recombination between 1 and 2 (or, never decompose the image)
