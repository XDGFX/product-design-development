# Describe an ordered statistics filter. What is the point of the denominator? [4]

output = (SUM(weight * x)) / (SUM(weight)) for all values of x inside window

example weights:
0   0   1   0   0   0   0   0   0
selects third smallest value
values do not need to be binary but they often are!

Dividing by the mean does NOT remove DC distortion, but it helps to reduce it
