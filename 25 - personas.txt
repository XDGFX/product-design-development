The persona should be representative of your customer segment but well-defined enough
that you can relate to them. They should not be real people, but hypothetical representations.

Give the persona a name and be detailed and specific about them. 

The persona is an individual, representative of a larger group of target market users

main points:
1. A User Persona is meant to stand in for a group of real people, a set of individuals
   who exist in the world and who would, in real life, be interested in your company’s product. 

2. A User Persona is usually presented as a one-page document, however, it is more than just
   another piece of work to be done and then forgotten about.

3. User Personas are not static templates, simple stereotypes, or interchangeable with the
   company’s next door. User Personas are living, breathing and ever evolving tools.

downfalls:
1. If a user persona is built solely from internal teams’ speculations, you risk inaccuracy
   and bias. For this reason, data is essential in confirming or revoking assumptions about
   potential consumers.

2. Not all data is created equal. Not all statistics are meaningful, unbiased, or pertinent.
   If you’re not careful, you could end up with a persona whose information regarding customer
   interests, challenges, and goals is outdated, insignificant, or simply wrong.
   
3. Inaccurate, trivial, and stale information constantly threatens user personas and the
   decisions made when referring to them.
