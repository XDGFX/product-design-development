the end of each higher level design proccess activity feeds down to create the design brief
for the lower level system task

conceptual design in a lower level can challenge preconceptions made by the design brief

this often being the defining process of a step change of radical innovation

lower levels are more detailed and constrained
higher levels are more abstract

this can be repeated at every system level
