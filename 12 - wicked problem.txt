1. There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem 
2. Wicked problems have no stopping rule
3. Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false, but good-or-bad
4. There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a  solution to a  wicked problem
5. Every solution to a wicked problem is a "one-shot operation"; because there is no opportunity to learn by trial-and-error, every attempt counts significantly 
6. Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or an exhaustively describable) set of potential solutions
7. Every wicked problem is essentially unique
8. Every wicked problem can be considered to be a  symptom of another problem
9. The choice of explanation determines the nature of the problem's resolution
10. The planner has no right to be wrong



- there is no finish point
- they are undefinable 
- you can't compute the solution
- they are unique
- they are a symptom of a larger issue
- there are infinite solutions
- there are no true or false solutions, only good or bad
- there is no immediate and ultimate test of if a solution is satisfactory
- it's a one-shot operation
- the choice of explanations determines the nature of the solution
