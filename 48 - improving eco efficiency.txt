assess impact > look for and implement solutions > check how effective changes are

assessment:
    LCA
    streamlined

    regulations and standards
        regulatory requirements (RoHS)
        voluntary government (ecolabels)
        voluntary branch specific (80+, energystar)

improvement:
    Design for Environment guidelines (DfE)
        Design for energy efficiency
            - standby, energy use of product
            - energy during use
            * Use discreet quantities
            * Auto turn off
            * Allow user control and adjustment
            * Provide feedback for use
        
        Design for disposal (eol)
            - remanufacturing (modular design, most valuable or fragile easy to access)
            - recycling (use widely recyclable materials, avoid irriversable joining)
