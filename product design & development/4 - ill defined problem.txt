# 4. Explain an ill-defined problem? [3]

An ill-defined problem is one in which the requirements do not contain sufficient
information to enable the designer to arrive at means of meeting those requirements simply by 
transforming, reducing, optimizing or superimposing the given information alone. 
Some of the necessary further information may be discoverable simply by searching for it,
some may be generateable by experiment, some may turnout to be statistically variable, 
some may be vague or unreliable, some may arise from capricious fortune or 
transitory preference and some may be actually unknowable.
