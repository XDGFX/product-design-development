# 6. You have been tasked a design task for which you have limited experience, and told to stick to the brief. Explain two possible problems with this [8]

used to solve wicked problems

design from experience - i.e. analogies, previous iterations, nature

associating something old with something new
reminded of the previously solved problem because of relevance to the new problem
e.g. 18m bridge from experience with 15m bridge

New problem

   Recall  <---  $CASE BASE$
     |                ^
     V                |
   Adapt  --->  New solution

   Case base built from practice or learning

question the brief

solving ill defined problems is a co-evolution of the brief and the solution

waterfall model vs co-evolution
