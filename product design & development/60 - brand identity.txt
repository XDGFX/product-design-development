# 60. Discuss the differences between brand identity from product predecessors and product families. [6]

The use of brand in styling is kind of cyclical.

If the brand-identity exists it is used to set the styling objectives.
If the brand is new the styling of the products in range range/series all need to build that brand identity.

So assuming the brand is established: product families and product predecessors will often have the largest influence on product styling (dominating the process). 

Product predecessors: using visual language and styling cues from a series of products
Product families: : using visual language and styling cues from a range of products (on the market at the same time)
