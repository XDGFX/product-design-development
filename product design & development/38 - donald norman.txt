# 38. Discuss the general contribution Donald Norman made to the user centred design approach. [4]

The ultimate product can powerfully do its job whilst being:
	Simple to use
	Easy to understand
	Safe to use

You have failed to design a user-centred product if you need to resort to:
	labels
	instruction manuals
	training courses

During the use of any product, the user should be able to:
1. Figure out what to do
2. Tell what is going on

‘warning labels and large instruction manuals are signs of failure, attempts to patch up
problems that should have been avoided by proper design in the first place’ (Norman, 1998)

‘There is plenty of evidence to show that even the best-trained and best-motivated
designers go wrong when using their instinct instead of testing their ideas on
actual users.’ (Norman,1998)
