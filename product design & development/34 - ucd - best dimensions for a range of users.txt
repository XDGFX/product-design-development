# 34. How can you ensure you are designing your product to fit the widest range of users? [10]

1. understand the use of the product
    emergency situations where all users must fit
    costs etc

2. anthropometrics of user population (target market)
    how do these measurements set constriants
    population distribution - bell curve
    key constraint criteria (e.g. reach, strength)

Design for:
1. Limiting user
2. Common fit
3. Allow adjustment

Methods of analysis
- Fitting trial (test for greatest number of acceptable sizes, or set yourself to too high / too low)
- Methods of limits; anthropometric data as a real people substitute 
- Body link diagrams, how human movements are constrained
- Simulation of digital human models
