# 48. What steps might you take to improve the eco-efficiency of an existing product such as an electric piano? [10]

assess impact > look for and implement solutions > check how effective changes are

assessment:
    LCA
    streamlined

    regulations and standards
        regulatory requirements (RoHS)
        voluntary government (ecolabels)
        voluntary branch specific (80+, energystar)

improvement:
    Design for Environment guidelines (DfE)
        Design for energy efficiency
            - standby, energy use of product
            - energy during use
            * Use discreet quantities
            * Auto turn off
            * Allow user control and adjustment
            * Provide feedback for use
        
        Design for disposal (eol)
            - remanufacturing (modular design, most valuable or fragile easy to access)
            - recycling (use widely recyclable materials, avoid irriversable joining)


SAMPLE ANSWER

Life Cycle Analysis
        1. Define the boundaries of the system
        2. Perform an inventory analysis to determine all elementry flows in and out
        3. Determine weighting of each flow (e.g. ReCiPe 2008)
        4. Determine hot spots, work to improve

Or shorter alternative such as MIPS Material Input Per unit of Service
        Ecological ruckack; weight in vs useful weight out

MECO
        Material, Energy, Chemicals, Other

Use of guidelines
        e.g. required hazardous regulations e.g. ReHS
        voluntary ecolabels e.g. energystar
        brach specific e.g. 80+ efficiency

Redesign to adhere to these

Design for Environment Guidelines

Design for Disposal (End of Life)
        Allow for recycle
        - easy to separate materials
        - widely recyclable materials

        Allow for remanufacture
        - modular design
        - allow disassembly of valuable or fragile parts

        Allow for reuse
        - alternative use, repurpose etc

Design for Energy Efficiency
        - Discreet quantities
        - Auto off / standby
        - visibility of energy usage
        - User adjustability
