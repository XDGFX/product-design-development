# 10. How could you make more money while being more sustainable, without modifying the product. [10]

only last two are relevant without changing the product

1. product optimisation
2. product redesign
3. function innovation
4. system innovation

factors earlier in the causal chain are more influential

SAMPLE ANSWER

The four pillars of innovation
1. Product optimisation
        In this case, the product is not to be modified so this is not relevant

2. Product redesign
        Again, the product is not to be changed. This would involve altering the method in which the product achieves it's goal to be done in a more sustainable way

3. Function innovation
        The function of the product could possibly be adapted to serve multiple purposes; is the problem that you're solving compatible with another problem, allowing greater value?

4. System innovation
        Is the problem you're solving a symptom of a larger fundamental problem? Could that be solved instead? By taking a systems approach, preconceptions about what a product must provide are challenged. Possibly the product would work as a PSS - possibly allowing for reduced impact and product usage while maximising revenue.

Alternative options could include:
        Analysing the product cycle, looking up the causal chain and determining if there are hot spots in the process which could be optimised (PLA)
