# 13. Give me three methods of assessing the environmental impact of a product. Explain the most suitable for a product in the conceptual design phase [6]

LCA
MECO
MIPS

MECO or MIPS most suitable

MECO - Materials, Energy, Chemicals, Other
Matrix which sums up and determines where the major impact areas are
Fast, but imprecise

MIPS - Material Input Per unit of Service (The ecological rucksack)
Classify impact by weight of material usage in vs useful out
