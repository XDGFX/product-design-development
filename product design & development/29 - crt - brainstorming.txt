# 29. Describe a method of idea generation within a team, and discuss best practices and common mistakes with the method. [10]

brainstorming is a group activity
but people are more creative on their own
you need diverse teams, not necessarily the best people (experts)
give time to develop initial ideas, then discuss
collaborative environment - challenge ideas but don't judge

good brainstorming:
    - many ideas
    - no criticism
    - the room remembers
    - build off eachothers ideas
    - stretch mental muscles first
    - have a facilitator
    - sharpen the focus
    - physical prototypes
    - practice

bad brainstorming:
    - boss speaks first
    - take turns to speak
    - experts only
    - idea fixation
    - exhaustive notes
