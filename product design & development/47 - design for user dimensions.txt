# 47. How do you choose a dimension that will fit a range of users? [10]

How to choose the best dimensions for design:
    1. The anthropometric characteristics of the user population.
    2. The ways in which these characteristics might impose constraints upon the design.
    3. The criteria that define an effective match between the product and the user.

    bell curve distribution

    5 - 90 - 5 percentile rule

    anthropometric key constraint criteria:
        clearance
        reach
        posture
        strength

Solutions:
    1. Design for the limiting user.
    2. Define an area of common fit.
    3. Provide adjustment. 

Methods of analysis:
    Fitting trials
    Limiting anthropometric data
    Body link diagram
    Digital human simulation models
    

SAMPLE ANSWER

ensure you are aware of the user base that will use your product, so you can gather suitable anthropometric data or testing participants

then, three methods:

Design for limiting user (extremes)
        Useful in safety situations, e.g. trying to determine the force required to open a fire door, use the weakest person as a guide

Design for greatest fit (using trials, median)
        People fit will be some form of normal distribution; most people are in the middle
        Use percentiles (e.g. 5-90-5 rule)
        Or, fitting trials where people outline on a range of sizes which are acceptable, or at what points the product is no longer acceptable

Allow adjustability
        May be linked with previous, allow movement and manual adjustment by the user to ensure it is comfortable (e.g. desk height)
