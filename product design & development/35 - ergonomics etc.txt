ergonomics is ensuring a good fit between people and their objects, activities, and environments.
    physical:
        anatomical
        anthropometric
        physiological

        perception
        cognition
        memory

        emotion
        * software design

ucd is a style of design and development which has an early focus on the user
    aiming to design a system/product that supports the users needs rather than making
    a product or system to which the user has to adapt. 
    * uses questionnaires, performance data, prototypes, participative design

    "Understand the user, know what they want, give it to them."

interaction design is design of user interfaces
    simple or complex
    digital or analogue
    easy to use interactive systems
    human computer interaction
