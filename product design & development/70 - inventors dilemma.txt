# 70. Describe the inventor's dilemma [8]

The Innovatorâ€™s Dilemma is a choice managers and engineers must make whether they pursue a strategy of Disruptive or Sustaining Innovation? Sustaining Innovation is the other side of the Disruptive approach. Any innovation activity (Radical, Incremental, or Breakthrough) that pursues an increase in profitability, a climbing of the customer value curve, improving performance for existing customer markets is deemed to be sustaining.

The dilemma is due to the fact that sustaining innovation usually always makes more logical sense to follow. It is always less risky to serve the needs of your existing customers, continuing to make the existing products better and operating in a known market. Than to gamble on a new thing that may or may not prove successful.
