nigel cross design thinking

1. take a personal approach to the brief, question the brief, steer towards greater opportunity

2. Take a broad systems approach to the problem, go beyond the part or object being designed, understand the entire system context in depth

3. Design from first principles; use funamental physics and minimalistic approach. Form follows function.
