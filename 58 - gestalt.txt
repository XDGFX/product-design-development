All about patterns

a. We are programmed to extract visual patterns:
		rule of proximity
		rule of similarity (concerns: shape, colour, size)
		rule of good continuation
b. Symmetry rule: we find it very easy to detect symmetry (or incomplete symmetry) even when viewing an object from an angle
c. Geometric form rule: we can detect simple geometric forms more easily than complex geometry forms

    - Visual patterns e.g. mobile device buttons
    - Simple geometric forms tend to be symmentrical; the two are related

Arc of positive feedback on visual complexity; starts indifferent, rises to a peak, then falls to distaste 
    However people tend to be indifferent about products that are too simple and negative about products that are too complex.
