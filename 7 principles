knowledge in the world and in the head


simplify structure of tasks
- change the nature of the task
- automate
- make things visible
- use mental aids

make things visible
- know the state before and after a task

mappings right
- determine relationships between intentions and their possible actions
- relationship between actions adn their system effects
- e.g. linear input gives linear output

exploit constriants


design for errors
- any error that can be made, will be made
- allow to recover from errors

all else fails
- learn only once
- then becomes an international standard
