The designer can sketch a generic model and use CAD to generate many alternative concepts
By determining the parameters that effect the form (in the case of a glass tumbler: height and diameter) 
we can use the computer to generate many alternatives (glass designs to hold the same volume)

If you do not have  styling brief you might just pro-actively generate styling options to evaluate as part of the design process.

Benefits of using CAD to generate many alternative concepts:
Allows the designer to consider many alternatives in a short time.
All concepts are drawn in exactly the same style, allows fair comparison

As you increase the number of different parameters, the number of different designs increases exponentially. 


This method of concept generation is also called ‘product feature permutation’ (Tjalve, 1979)

Explore the arrangement of the functional elements for product form options.
1. Feature abstraction: which features deliver the main functions
2. Features that are inextricably linked, can be treated as one element
3. Systematically rearrange the features of a product according to all the possible permutations

- linear
- perpendicular
- partly embedded
- fully embedded
