It is understood that people hold visual and wordy information in two different streams in
their heads known as the Visuo-spatial Scratchpad and the Phonological Loop.

The Visuo-spatial scratchpad holds shapes and images while the phonological loop holds words
and sounds (particularly words that have been read and are being repeated in the head on a loop).
The visual part is more primitive and also faster so it can be used with great effect as a shortcut. 

Depth vs breadth argument
- limited attention span but
- limited memory
solution: tabs

Scaffolding
    - slowly take away hints until they are no longer needed

Spaced retrieval for learning
    Consider 'overlearning'
