How to choose the best dimensions for design:
    1. The anthropometric characteristics of the user population.
    2. The ways in which these characteristics might impose constraints upon the design.
    3. The criteria that define an effective match between the product and the user.

    5 - 90 - 5 percentile rule

    anthropometric key constraint criteria:
        clearance
        reach
        posture
        strength

Solutions:
    1. Design for the limiting user.
    2. Define an area of common fit.
    3. Provide adjustment. 

Methods of analysis:
    Fitting trials
    Limiting anthropometric data
