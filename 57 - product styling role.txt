Styling is widely accepted as an important way to add value to a product without changing its technical performance

Certain types of products are overtly style-driven, and there are industries where the importance of styling has long been accepted: e.g. car industry and clothing industry 

Other industries benefit in a more subtle way and pro-active product styling is a relatively recent phenomenon: machinery, medical products
